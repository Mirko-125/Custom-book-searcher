His readings of luminosity were made without any hesitation, and were
concordant for each observation, which is not to be wondered at, as the
matches, except at the blue end, were practically matches of different
mixtures of black and white.

It appears that the white which X. sees as white is the same as the
orange sodium light, and that the red he sees is yellowish. The mixture
of this yellowish-white with the blue makes white. He sees a little
blue in the spectrum colour at λ 5720, so it must be taken that at
that point of the spectrum he begins to see colour--a point which is
considerably lower than that given by his preliminary examination
of the spectrum colour, and due, no doubt, to the fact that in this
experiment he had the white light of the positive pole of the electric
light to compare with it. It seems probable that what X. called
yellowish was really a sensation of white mixed with a very small
quantity of red sensation, for he saw no yellow in the orange, in
which that colour would be most easily distinguished on account of its
luminosity. Red light, when strongly diluted with white light, to the
normal eye is often called orange.

As, practically speaking, the colour vision of X. is confined to blue
and white, it is of interest to note the difference in luminosity at
the different parts of the spectrum that is registered by him and by
P., who had blue (violet) monochromatic vision. To facilitate the
comparison, the luminosity curve of the latter is shown in the diagram.

The thin line curve is the normal curve.]

Perhaps another case of a patient suffering from tobacco blindness may
be quoted, as it will show the differences that exist in recognising
the colours of the spectrum, and that the shorter the visible limit of
the spectrum at the red end, the more pronounced is the extent
