œNo; but you asked me,â€ said the cunning old rogue of a landlord.

â€œI am damned if I did!â€ said the angry mariner.

â€œWell, you didnâ€™t then,â€ said the landlord, with a soft smile, â€œbut I
thought you did.â€

The sailor turned his ugly face full on the landlordâ€™s. He looked him
over steadily and fiercely. He then put down his pipe, spread out the
palm of one hand, and tapped upon it with two fingers of the other to
lend an emphasis to what he was about to say. And he chose his words
with a most particular and deliberate care.

â€œNow look you here, mate,â€ said he, â€œI know the sort you are. Iâ€™ve not
followed the sea and run cargoes on this coast for twenty year without
getting a wind as to the repitation of Gamaliel Hooker. I know the
kind oâ€™ man you are, my hearty. But Iâ€™m just going to sing a word in
your ear. Iâ€™m a plain-dealing man, I am: rough, youâ€™ll say, almighty
rough; but Iâ€™m a man oâ€™ my word, and you can lay to that. Now, if a
young man comes to your lousy, rat-ridden old hulk of a tavern, and
asks for Diggory Fargus, you just have the goodness to tell him heâ€™ll
find me showing a light from the boat, at twelve oâ€™clock at midnight,
a short sea-mile up the shore at Pylerâ€™s Cove. You just tell him that.
And if he should come, you are to keep him snug, dâ€™ye see, here in this
house till nightfall. He must not be seen by a living soul. Do this, my
hearty, and you may have such a reward one day as will go beyond your
dreams. But you just play me false, mate; you just send the young man
to the wrong place, or set it abroad that heâ€™s at your tavern, and as
surely as Diggory Fargus hath followed the sea for twenty years, he
will twist your head off your body with these two hands.â€

To the deliberation of the seamanâ€™s words was added a fierceness of
countenance that made the landlord quail. Gamaliel grew terrified. He
was fascinated by that unpleasant face. When Diggory Fargus pointed
his threat by expanding his great gnarled brown paws, sweat sprang out
of the landlordâ€™s hair. When his eyes fell on the knife that gleamed
at the seamanâ€™s waist, he was held in the paralysis of fear. And, in
the height of his sufferings, the mariner bestowed a kind of dramatic
poignance upon them, by laughing aloud at poor Gamalielâ€™s fat, pale
face; by striding to the door, flinging it wide, and disappearing into
the wintry darkness.

It was not easy for the landlord to recover of his terror. Your rogue
is a nervous creature. How often does he anticipate his doom! When the
wind sighs through the branches, he hea
