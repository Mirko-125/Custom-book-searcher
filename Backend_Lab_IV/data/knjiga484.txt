€œThe King,â€ said the landlord, forming a word at last.

â€œYes, the King; what of him?â€ said the Sergeant. â€œHe is lying on his
bed upstairs.â€

â€œNo, no, no!â€ said the landlord. â€œNo, no, no!â€

â€œWhy, fool, what is the matter?â€ said the Sergeant, losing his patience.

â€œThe King is----!â€

The landlord fell back in his chair unconscious.

  CHAPTER
  XVI

  _The departing
  Guests_]


The Sergeant unloosed the landlordâ€™s coat and ordered one of his men to
procure water and dash it in his face. But Gamaliel had gone too far
to be brought round easily, and the time spent in restoring him to his
senses was the Kingâ€™s deliverance.

Presently the landlord opened his eyes and looked about him. The
reaction brought with it a full measure of consciousness, and with it
a command of his faculties. He could think; and, now it was too late,
the power of speech was again vouchsafed to him.

â€œThe King went out at that door!â€ he cried. â€œThe King is escaped! That
was the King you conducted to the door.â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€ demanded the astonished Sergeant. â€œSpeak, clown and
fool that you are! I tell you the King is upstairs.â€

The landlord had now the power to unbosom his soul; and there was
such a singular fervour of conviction in his words, that the soldier,
vividly impressed by them, and bewildered by them too, made all haste
up the stairs to Captain Culpeper, who, as he supposed, was still
attending on the King.

The thoroughly alarmed and uneasy Sergeant came to him at the side of
the bed, and recited the landlordâ€™s story.

â€œWhat is this you say, Sergeant Williams?â€ said the Captain.

His heart sank with an overmastering foreboding that the landlord
had spoken the truth. He had not known the King when he entered the
chamber, never having set eyes upon his Majesty before; and none of his
men knew him either--they had only hearsay to guide them. Could it be
that he was the victim of a trick. He turned furiously upon the man in
the bed and the woman beside him.

â€œMy God!â€ he said, â€œyou have duped me; you have deceived me. The Kingâ€™s
servitor was the King. You have been playing a part.â€

The man and the woman looked at him defiantly. Every instant they could
maintain their rÃ´les was of the utmost advantage to the fugitive; and
in any case their own lives were forfeit.

â€œWhat do you mean?â€ said young Lord Farnham, striving to enact the
comedy to the bitter end.

â€œWe have been tricked!â€ cried the Captain.

The truth had burst upon Captain Culpeper with stunning force. He saw
it all. He became as one beside himself. He stamped
