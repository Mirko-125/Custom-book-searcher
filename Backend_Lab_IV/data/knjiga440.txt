€™s men. He gazed tenderly on the bright
jewel in his hand. He amused himself by computing the value of the
stones within it, and figuring out in his mind what he stood to gain.
These were brave times indeed! Why, he had already earned more during
that last half-hour than in a year of quiet, jog-trot trading. And this
was, doubtless, nothing to the wealth they had upstairs. He only hoped
the soldiers would not return and discover their owners, ere he could
take them for himself. But Master Gamaliel was not without a certain
confidence in his own acquisitiveness; he shrewdly suspected that in
any case they were doomed to lodge in his custody. Oh, if the King
would only come his way as well!

He then turned his attention to the strange events of the night. He
was morally sure that the woman had gone forth to discover Diggory
Fargusâ€™s boat or that of some other mariner, and that her meeting with
Will Jackson, the serving-man, was, as far as she was concerned, an
accidental one. But what could account for her extraordinary behaviour
on his appearance? Why had she adopted so wrought and passionate an
attitude towards him? Most probably for the same reason that she had
adopted it a little later towards himself: she feared him. Him, too,
she had been beseeching. Of course she had been begging him not to
betray her; but why should she be at such pains to implore a fellow
like that not to do so? The landlord recalled the incident of Will
Jackson going up the ladder. It was then he first knew that she and her
husband were at the inn. Gamaliel recalled how his serving-man had
rushed pellmell to the ground as though he had seen a ghost, whilst
the woman above pierced the night with her wild cry. What could be the
significance of that recognition?

The landlord built a theory. This Will Jackson had probably been lately
in their employment; and the woman knowing him to be so well acquainted
with their circumstances, and that he was doubtless a rogue to boot,
she felt her husband to be undone. Again, the serving-manâ€™s surprise
would not be unnatural. It would be a rather dramatic thing to go up
that ladder, and for him to discover his former patrons thus. Assuming
that to be the case, it was not unlikely that the woman, utterly
desperate as she was, ventured into the night to find Will Jackson and
to propitiate him with her prayers. Yet, after all, she was not likely
to find him by the side of the sea.

The landlord was unable to settle this last point definitely in his
mind; but the remainder of the theory he thought very excellent.
However, be that as it may, he would take the first opportunity
of having Will Jacksonâ€™s version
