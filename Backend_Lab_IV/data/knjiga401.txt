d be vindicated
in the person of the surviving Stuart. However, the redoubtable
Cromwell wasted no time on vow-making, but with his usual energy
placed himself in the rear of the Royalist army and cut it off from
communication with Scotland. Prince Charlie was thus compelled to
continue his march on England. He got as far as Worcester, where the
mayor and certain unclassibles crowned him King Charles the Second.
But on the same day Cromwell appeared for the coronation festivities
and a memorable battle ensued, lasting five hours. The Scots were
decisively routed. Prince Charlie escaped, and after experiencing many
vicissitudes and amazing adventures, extending over a period of some
six weeks, finally succeeded in being smuggled aboard a waiting vessel
and so won safely away to Normandy.

It was this period of outlawry, during which a price was set on the
royal head of Charles Stuart and he was being hunted like a dangerous
criminal, that Mr. Snaith has employed as the basic theme on which to
graft a romance. In the main the narrative offers a striking instance
of the predominant trait of the Stuart character--the sovereignty of
the flesh to the exclusion of all else, even personal safety.
