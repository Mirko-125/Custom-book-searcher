rroundings will begin to
be seen, and after several minutes what before was blackness comes to
be invested with form and detail. So it is with the extinction of light
in the apparatus described. Observations carried on before the full
sensibility of the eye is attained are of no value. A recorded set of
observations will show this. A light of a certain character was thrown
on the extinction box, to be extinguished, and the observer entered
the darkened room from the full glare of daylight. The eye was placed
at the eye end and kept there, and the extinctions were made one after
the other till they became very fairly constant. The following is the
result:--

    Times of Observation.   Readings.
  At the commencement          1·0
  After         38 sec.        3·2
  After         53 sec.        4·9
  After  1 min. 11 sec.        6·9
  After  1 min. 44 sec.       10·5
  After  2 min. 43 sec.       17·0
  After  3 min. 44 sec.       27·5
  After  4 min. 52 sec.       43·0
  After  5 min. 59 sec.       63·0
  After  6 min. 41 sec.       78·0
  After  7 min. 28 sec.       89·0
  After  8 min. 32 sec.       96·0
  After 10 min. 46 sec.      103·0
  After 12 min.              103·0

  (For convenience the first reading is unity; the other numbers are
                the _inverse_ of the extinction value.)

The eye apparently, under the conditions in which these observations
were made, was at least 100 times more sensitive to very faint light
after twelve minutes than it was at the beginning, and that then
concordant readings could be made. It will now be quite understood that
before any serious measures can be made this interval must elapse,
and also that the light, finding its way to the end of the box to
illuminate the spot, should never be strong, otherwise the eye might
lose its sensitiveness.




CHAPTER X.


Before considering the subject of the extinction of light by other
types of colour vision, attention must be called to what has already
been brought before you. The various colours of the spectrum have to
be reduced to the following amounts before they suffer extinction, the
orange light at D being of the value of one candle. (See appendix, page
217, for complete tables.)

                    Reduction in
                     Millionths.                 Remarks.

                                           sensation

  C               1,100 or 1/909         rather more scarlet

  D                  50 or 1/20000       orange light

  E                 6·5 or 1/154000      a green chosen by Maxwell
                                           as a standard colour

  F                15·0 or 1/67000       beginning of the blue

  Blue Lithium     85·0 or 1/11700       a good sample of blue

  G               300·0 or 1/3300        approximately pure sensation
                                           of violet.
